						<p>If it hasnâ€™t sunk in yet, then a) you have a pretty thick cranium and b) happy birthday once again Rubal Mittal! It is tough for us to curb our leg-pulling desires and to write good nice sweet stuff for you. Because there is so little to write! I don't know what Saha sees in you that he took up this mammoth effort (please marry him right now, or I will). I don't know what we see in you that we want to make this day so special for you. Maybe it's the fact that you make the remaining days of the year special for us. Awww moment? <em>Love you too.</em></p>
						<p>From this year you start living in the real world, working in jobs, balancing personal and professional lives. So all the best for that. As I have told you countless times, you ought to loosen up a bit. Live your life achhe se. Don't try to prove a point to anybody at every thing you to. Don't make stupid judgments like Ahmedabad again. Don't try to be the righteous human being all the time. you are a good enough human being, now be thoda sa normal. <em>Love you too.</em></p>
						<p>I am writing all these good things not because I mean them, but because I need you as my lyricist. You write freakin' awesome poetry, and whoever says otherwise has zero sense of beauty. I am not used to comments like these after somebody listens to my song - "Nice..by the way the lines are awesome who wrote these?". "Rubal. How's the tune?". "Ya good but the lyrics are amazing man!!". You are stealing my thunder. I don't like it. Please keep writing such awesome stuff for me. You are already a member of my 'band'. <em>Love you too.</em></p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p> You are such an integral part of my life that it feels very weird to tell you all these. Has there ever been a day since PS-1 that we haven't talked to each other? (Holy shit I remember your birthday this time :D ). Has there ever been a facebook post/dp that we haven't analysed before showing it to the world? Has there ever been an issue that we haven't discussed among ourselves? Starting from the 'hypothetical' days to the 'almost' ones, from the polka dot days to the cleavage ones, from the PAVA days to the German ones, we have indeed come a very long way. [I was in this line when you buzzed me yesterday afternoon]. I have spilled more secrets into that chat window than I have thought to myself. <em>Love you too.</em></p>
						<p>Just one request. Be the way you are. And be my friend always. I know it's become tough lately. You might even hate me to some extent. But don't give up on me.</p>
						<p>Yup. <em>I love you.</em> And you know that very well.</p>
						<p>Happy birthday.</p>
